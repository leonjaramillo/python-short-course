    "## What is Python?\n",
    "- **Python** was created by __[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)__ and first released in 1991. Its current version is **3.14**. You can check Python versions history __[here](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)__.\n",
    "- Its name is inspired by _Monty Python's Flying Circus_, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s.\n",
    "- Python is an **interpreted**, **interactive**, **object-oriented** programming language.\n",
    "- Python is a **general-purpose**, **high-level** programming language, and its design philosophy emphasizes code readability.\n",
    "- Python aims to combine \"remarkable power with **very clear syntax**\", and its standard library is large and comprehensive.\n",
    "- Its use of **indentation** for block delimiters is unusual among popular programming languages.\n",
    "- Python features a **dynamic type** system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple **programming paradigms**, including object oriented, **imperative**, **functional** and **procedural**, and has a large and comprehensive **standard library**.\n",
    "- Python is widely used by many companies around the world, such as **Google**, **NVIDIA**, **Instagram**, **Facebook**, **Uber**, **Spotify**, and **NASA**.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Did you know...</b> That Python is much older than Java?\n",
    "Although Python, given its late popularity, appears to be a language newer than Java, it was first released in 1991, while Java was released in 1995.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can we get Python?\n",
    "- Firstly, we need to download and install Python itself, __[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)__.\n",
    "- Or we can use a distribution such as Anaconda, __[here](https://www.anaconda.com/)__.\n",
    "- We might use code editors, like __[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)__.\n",
    "- Or full-featured IDEs, like __[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)__.\n",
    "- Anaconda supports Jupyter Notebooks (like this one), but we can use online platforms like __[Google Colab](https://colab.google/)__ or __[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)__.\n",
    "## Where do we find more information about Python?\n",
    "- In its website (https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "- In Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).\n",
    "- In books, such as:\n",
    "    - _Learning Python_ by Mark Lutz\n",
    "    - _Python Essential Reference_ by David Beazley\n",
    "    - _Python Cookbook_ by Martelli, Ravenscroft and Ascher\n",
    "- In several websites, such as:\n",
    "    - Byte of Python (https://python.swaroopch.com/)\n",
    "    - Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)\n",
    "    - Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/python-101-beginners-coding-bootcamp-free-course/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brief Note:** If you want to execute Jupyter Notebooks using Google Chrome or Mozilla instead of Microsoft Edge, follow the instructions that you'll find in __[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB6zqGaNRnE)__."
